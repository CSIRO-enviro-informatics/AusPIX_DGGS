The header contains produduction information and abreviations (PREFIX) for the discriptive uri's used in the data sets.
The prefix is a placeholder for the full uri. This simplifies the human readability of the data and vastly reduces the size of the RDF store.

These are Turtle files. Turtle stands for "Terse RDF Triple Language".
