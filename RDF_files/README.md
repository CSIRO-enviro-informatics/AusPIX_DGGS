Clipped examples of files produced by these AusPix DGGS scripts (or CSIRO eg GNAF-Gefabric join).

Files can be opened by any text editor. Very large turtle files need to be opened by something like the 64bit version of Notepad++ which can open files greater than 1GB

The file header contains production information and abreviations (PREFIX) for the discriptive uri's used in the data sets.
The prefix is a placeholder for the full uri. This simplifies the human readability of data and vastly reduces the size of the RDF store.

These are Turtle files. Turtle stands for "Terse RDF Triple Language". Turtle files are better for human readability but still allow machine reads.
