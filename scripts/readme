AusPIX DGGS

These are developmental scripts designed to complete certain tasks.
Modification will be needed to point the script to your relevant files.

Most of this work is to develop ways to integrate data using DGGS, RDF and associated triple stores & servers. 

Ask Joseph Bell at GA for more recent scripts if needed
