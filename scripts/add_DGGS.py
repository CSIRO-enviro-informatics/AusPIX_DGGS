'''
reads a csv file and adds DGGS to it

This is for placeNames 
Placenames is from 2018 
A query was used to gather basic placename data into a csv
Code fields were converted into their full text equivalent while building the query

This code reflects the number of decimal points in the lat and long by adjusting the size of the DGGS box.
In practice the DGGS boxes were often too big. Needs adjusting eg a level DGGS 5 box is too big for anything.
