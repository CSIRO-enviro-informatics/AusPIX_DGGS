# AusPIX_DGGS
The AusPIX DGGS is an Australian Government implimentation of the rHealpix DGGS model.

Included in this repository is the rHealPIX "engine" and a series of scripts that use AusPIX in a variety of ways.

Additionally there are several 'callable' modules that perform common tasks in DGGS space. These are in the "callable_modules" folder.
